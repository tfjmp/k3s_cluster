## Overview
This project provisions a one master one worker HA Kubernetes cluster using `k3s` with `vagrant` and `VirtualBox`. HA is accomplished by using `etcd` as cluster data store.
Starting point is one master one worker, however, any number of masters/workers can be provisioned by changing the settings in `config.yaml`.

## Quickstart
```
$ git clone https://github.com/trankchung/k3s_cluster.git
$ cd k3s_cluster
$ vagrant up
$ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/k3s.yaml
$ kubectl get node -o wide
```
NOTES: By default `k3s.yaml` points to `https://k3s.local:6443` if `k3s.clusterName` is not set in `config.yaml`. Make sure `k3s.local` is resolvable from where `kubectl` is executed.
You may have to add `k3s.local` as an entry into `/etc/hosts` (Linux) or `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows) file.

## Troubleshooting
__Problem__: k3s won't start completely.

Make sure `k3s.datastoreEndpoint` in `config.yaml` is reachable for all master nodes. Do a telnet to that host and port and make sure it connects.


__Problem__: kubectl won't connect.

Make sure `k3s.clusterName` is reachable on port `6443` from where `kubectl` is executed.
